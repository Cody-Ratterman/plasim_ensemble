Requirements:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Following software components are necessary for running the models:

1. C          compiler (cc, gcc, sunfc)
2. C++        compiler (c++, g++)
3. FORTRAN-90 compiler (gfortran, g95, f90, sunf90)
4. make       utility  (make, gmake)
5. X11        include  (/usr/X11/include, /usr/X11R6/include)
6. X11        library  (/usr/X11/lib64    /usr/X11/lib)
7. NCL    plot software (https://www.ncl.ucar.edu/Download/list_of_binaries.shtml)
=======================================================================
Optional for multi-processor (parallel) program execution:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
mpi           message passing interface (mpich, openMPI)
mpif90        compiler
mpicc         compiler
mpirun        execution script
=======================================================================
The configure script tries to locate all necessary components.
If something is missing, you have to install these packages.
Most Linux distributions have these packages on board and all you
have to do is, to mark these for installation in the software manager.
All required software is available in free open source packages.
=======================================================================
1. Open a terminal window and enter the most directory.
2. Run "./configure.sh" in this directory
3. Run "make" in the most AND postprocessor directory.
4. Type "most.x" or "./most.x" to run the "Model Starter".
5. Choose model "Planet Simulator" with a mouse click.
6. Set "Parallelism" and "Resolution".
    For using more than 1 core you must have MPI (Message Passing Interface).
    Standard resolutions are: T21 (64x32 grid), T31 (96x48), and T42 (128x64).
7. Under "Options" deselect "Run with GUI" and select "Write Output".
8. Click on the button "Save & Exit" to build the model. 

Additional Ensemble Notes
=======================================================================
 9. Use "cp plasim/run/* ensemble_data/template/" to copy from run to template directory.
10. Use "rm ensemble_data/template/most_plasim_run" to remove the origional model script.
11. Check/Change namelists and surface files in template folder.

12. Edit "ensemble_data/template/most_plasim_run_mod" to edit run procedure and section lengths.
    Edit "ensemble_data/ensemble_plasim_run" to edit ensemble procedure and model counts.
13. Run "./ensemble_plasim_run"
    Updates will appear on console and in "ensemble_status.txt".

14. "ensemble_plasim_run" also does postprocessing.
    "ensemble_postProcess" will re-postprocess the runs.
    Warning: Do NOT run "ensemble_plasim_run" and "ensemble_postProcess" at the same time.
             Variables for run and section counts will overwrite each other. 
15. Pre-made ncl plotting codes are located in "plots".
    "ensemble_plots" runs all ncl code in the current and sub-directories.
